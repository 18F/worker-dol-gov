  - "<b>Resolution</b>: Baltazar received $11,600 in back wages, and his co-workers received theirs. As a penalty for the wage violation, their employer cannot bid on any government jobs for three years. Baltazar is also now an advocate for fighting wage violations."
  - "If you are concerned about your company’s pay practices, let us know about it (link to homepage). You also can check to see if back wages are being held for you as the result of an investigation using the online tool, Workers Owed Wages."

Baltazar Rincón performed plumbing and sheet metal work on a federal court building in Yuma, Arizona, but his employer failed to pay him the legally required prevailing wage rates and fringe benefits for his labor. Rincón was underpaid by $11,600, money badly needed to provide for his wife and six children. An investigation by the Wage and Hour Division’s Phoenix District Office helped secure his back wages, and Rincón was so grateful he drove more than three and 1/2 hours from Yuma to Phoenix to personally thank the investigators and agency administrator David Weil, who was visiting the district office.

The investigation of Rincón’s employer, Tempe Mechanical, found $114,524 in back wages due to 24 workers for violations of the Davis-Bacon Act’s prevailing wage and fringe benefits requirements. Eighteen of these employees were shorted an additional $18,135 in overtime pay. The business has paid all back wages plus liquidated damages and civil monetary penalties. Tempe Mechanical has also been debarred from bidding on government contracts for three years.

“The back wage check I received helped my family tremendously, but you also helped the families of my coworkers,” Baltazar told us. “The economic stimulus they received with the back pay made them very happy. Your agency helps many people and you do it without expecting anything in return.”

Rincón also brought his son, Daniel, who was able to learn about the Wage and Hour Division by attending a stakeholder meeting with Weil and some of the major worker advocacy groups in Arizona. Daniel is a high school student who also works to help support his family. “I try to put myself in my dad’s shoes. I know how hard it is for him to provide for six children and a wife,” he said.
