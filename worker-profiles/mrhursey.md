"I got a phone call from OFCCP. I didn't even know that there was a branch of government that looked out for my interest like that. They told me that they were looking into the hiring practices of a company that I had applied to, and that they had found in their investigation some discrimination going on. They told me they were going to work on my behalf to obtain back wages owed to me. To be honest, I thought that it was going to be swept under the rug, not to be heard from again. Five months after they called me I got a check from the construction company. They gave me back wages from the time that I applied for the job up until their investigation. And I was genuinely happy! I was able to get things for my kids, I was able to take care of some bills, and man, it just felt good to know that the government was there for me.”
