When workers alleged that the grocery chain El Super was refusing to bargain with union locals and mistreating unionized workers, the National Labor Relations Board stepped in to investigate. 
El Super employs 45,000 people at 50 markets across California, Arizona and Nevada. 
600 employees represented by United Food and Commercial Workers locals at seven El Super stores in Los Angeles found victory after NLRB helped the grocery store chain come to an agreement to remedy worker complaints. 
One employee who had been with the chain for 7 years, Fermin Rodriguez, got his job back plus seven months of back-pay after being fired for supporting the union. 
Conditions of the settlement include posting signs saying that the chain cannot refuse to negotiate and let workers know that they have a right to bargain together with representation.
