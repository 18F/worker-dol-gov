Sujhey Hernandez of South Carolina, immigrated to the U.S. with her family when she was a child from Veracruz, Mexico, in search of a better life. After graduating high school, she found work as a server at Casa Linda Mexican restaurant in Columbia. Although she was happy to be employed, she knew “something didn’t seem right” regarding her pay.
For more than a year, she worked around 55 hours a week but only received tips from her employer. Unfortunately, this is a situation that the Wage and Hour Division finds all too frequently in the restaurant industry, where low-wage workers don’t always know their rights or who to turn to when there is a problem.
The division conducted an investigation of Casa Linda and found that Sujhey and her coworkers had been shorted due to minimum wage and overtime violations. Ultimately, she received $23,885 in back pay.
This is where Sujhey’s story takes an interesting twist; instead of returning to restaurant work, she took a chance and listened to her heart. “I am smart and determined and knew I could do more,” she said.
She quit her job and used the back wages to enroll in the Palmetto School of Career Development‘s Dental Assisting Chairside program, an 11-week intensive class. Labor Department funding provided to state and local areas helps pay the cost for important training programs, like this one, that prepare workers for in-demand jobs.
She found work as a receptionist at a local dentist’s office after completing the course. While at work one day several months ago, Sujhey was surprised to see Luis Medina, the Wage and Hour investigator who had helped uncover the violations at her restaurant, walk in for an appointment.
“I was so happy to see him and wanted him to know how much he changed my life,” she shared.
He recently came back for another appointment, and discovered that Sujhey is not behind a desk now. Today she is proud to work in the exam rooms as a dental assistant, and credits the Labor Department for helping her achieve her dreams.
