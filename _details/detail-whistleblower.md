An employer cannot retaliate by taking "adverse action" against workers who report injuries, safety concerns, or other protected activity. You should not be discriminated for exercising your rights under the OSH Act. These rights include:

- filing an OSHA complaint
- participating in an inspection or talking to an inspector
- seeking access to employer exposure and injury records
- reporting an injury
- Request an OSHA inspection, and speak to the inspector
- raising a safety or health complaint with the employer
- If you have been retaliated or discriminated against for exercising your rights, you must file a complaint with OSHA within 30 days of the alleged adverse action.
