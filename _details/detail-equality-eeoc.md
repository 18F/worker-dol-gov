You have the right to be treated equally regardless of your race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy, gender identity, and sexual orientation), age (40 or older), disability, genetic information, citizenship, immigration status, or national origin. You have the right to complain about discrimination, file a charge of discrimination, and participate in an employment discrimination investigation or lawsuit without being retaliated against. You have a right to religious accommodations, or reasonable accommodations for your disability, unless doing so would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the employer's business.

## Does your employer do business with the federal government?
If your employer does business with the federal government, complaints should go through OFCCP.
