Please call the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) at 1-800-397-6251.

All services are free and confidential, whether you’re documented or not. We will not disclose any information to your employer unless you decide to file a formal complaint.

## Learn about filing a complaint

We’ll help you decide what to do next, and conduct an investigation if you decide to file a formal complaint. Because you must file a complaint within 180 days of the alleged discrimination, it is best to begin the process early. If your complaint relates to your disability or veteran status, it must be filed within 300 days.

Please note that it is illegal for your employer to fire, demote, harass, or otherwise retaliate against you for reporting an issue to OFCCP.
