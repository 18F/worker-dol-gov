Please call the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) at 1-800-321-6742.

All services are free and confidential, whether you’re documented or not. We will not disclose any information to your employer unless you decide to file a formal complaint.

## Learn about filing a complaint

We’ll help you decide what to do next, and conduct an investigation if you decide to file a formal complaint. Because you must file a complaint within 6 months of the alleged violation to take further legal action, it is best to begin the process early.

Please note that it is illegal for your employer to fire, demote, harass, or otherwise retaliate against you for reporting an issue to OSHA.
