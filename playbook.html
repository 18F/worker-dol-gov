    <h1>WE WORK FOR YOU.</h1>

    <h2>The Goal</h2>
    <p>We want to build a site designed for you  that includes you in the process. A site that helps workers understand – and exercise – their rights.  A site that adapts to your needs and includes principles set by workers and advocates. If you’re interested in contributing to future versions of Worker.gov, visit our <a href="https://github.com/presidential-innovation-fellows/worker-dol-gov">GitHub repository</a>.</p>

    <h2>The Story</h2>
    <p>Worker.Gov was developed in response to feedback received during listening sessions with workers across the United States. A joint effort by the U.S. Departments of Labor and Justice, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the National Labor Relations Board, these conversations took place in 2014-2016 as part of the Vulnerable Workers Project and the White House Summit on Worker Voice. In collaboration with The Presidential Innovation Fellows, these agencies came together to deliver workers the assistance they need in the way they need. The site operates as a portal that predicts workers’ needs, with an easier user experience than most government sites. Input collected at the outset will direct workers to the resources they need, without forcing them to guess which federal agency or statute covers their situation.</p>
    <p>This approach uses Human-Centered Design and Agile methodologies for a more effective site. Building on conversations with workers and advocates, in October 2016, we launched an initial version of the site and a process to continue this dialogue through technology. We look forward to soon adding content in multiple languages, starting with Spanish; adding additional occupational profiles; and telling more stories about real workers standing up for themselves to make a difference in their lives.</p>
    <p>The more feedback you, the user, give and the more you use the site, the better future versions will be. </p>
    <p>We invite you to provide input here.</p>
