You have a right to be treated equally regardless of a disability if you are qualified for a job in the private sector (if the employer has 15 or more employees) or state, local, and federal governments. You have a right to complain about discrimination, file a charge of discrimination, and participate in an employment discrimination investigation or lawsuit.

You have a right to reasonable accommodations for any known physical or mental limitations resulting from a disability if you are otherwise qualified, unless doing so would impose undue hardship on the operation of the employerâ€™s business.

### What this means for you


Employers are not allowed to discriminate against you based on the fact that you:

- have a physical or mental disability that substantially limits one or more major life activities
- have a record of having a disability
- are regarded as having a disability

### Examples of discrimination

In general, this means that you cannot be:

- fired
- rejected for a job or promotion
- given lesser assignments
- forced to take leave

because of a disability.
