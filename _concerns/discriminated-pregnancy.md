Employers are not allowed to discriminate against you based on the fact that:

- you are pregnant
- you were pregnant
- you could become pregnant, or intend to become pregnant
- you have a medical condition that is related to pregnancy
- you had an abortion, or are considering having an abortion

### Examples of discrimination

In general, this means that you cannot be:

- fired
- rejected for a job or promotion
- given lesser assignments
- forced to take leave

because of a pregnancy.
